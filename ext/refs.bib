abstract = {When and where did information get constructed as a disembodied medium? How were researchers convinced that humans and machines are brothers under the skin? Although the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics were not the only forum grappling with these questions, they were particularly important because they acted as a crossroads for the traffic in cybernetic models and artifacts. This chapter charts the arguments that made information seem more important than materiality within this research community. Broadly speaking, the arguments were deployed along three fronts. The first was concerned with the construction of information as a theoretical entity; the second, with the construction of (human) neural structures so that theywere seen as flows of information; the third, with the construction of artifacts that translated information flows into observable operations, thereby making the flows "real." Yet at each of these fronts, there was also significant resistance to the reification of information. Alternate models were proposed; important qualifications were voiced; objections were raised to the disparity between simple artifacts and the complex problems they addressed. Reification was triumphant not because it had no opposition but because scientifically and culturally situated debates made it seem a better choice than the alternatives. Recovering the complexities of these debates helps to demystify the assumption that infomation is more essential than matter or energy. Followed back to moments before it became a blackbox, this conclusion seems less like an inevitability and more like the result of negotiations specific to the circumstances of the U.S. techno-scientific culture during and immediately following World War 11.},

abstract = {Quantified self-experimentation with personal diets is a popular activity among health enthusiasts, diagnosed patients, as well as "life hackers" pursuing self-optimization goals. In this paper, we reflect on self-experimentation practices in the context of amateur citizen science communities. We report findings from 11 month-long qualitative fieldwork in a community of nutrition hobbyists experimenting with a powdered food substitute "soylent". Our respondents customized the soylent powders to their personal needs, tracked their metabolic reactions to the diet, and discussed their findings with the online soylent user community. Although the data and knowledge sharing within the community positively impacted respondents' nutrition literacy, these activities created risks regarding their health safety and data privacy. We define soylent self-experimentation as a form of "extreme citizen science". Based on the limitations identified in the soylent community, we suggest a set of design recommendations for extreme citizen science projects.},

abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of using statistical classification of physiological signals into emotion categories as a resource for open-ended human interpretation of emotion. Typically, design studies for affect assume either that it is possible for computers to objectively identify users' emotions, or that emotion is completely subjective and thus rely solely on human interpretation. By drawing on the feminist concept of performativity, we explain how to conceive of computational representations and human actors as co-constructing emotions. Through a case study of Freaky, a system that uses such models of emotion to sup-port human interpretation, we demonstrate how machine learning models of affect can be constructed and incorporated in systems designed for open-ended user interpretation of affect. Qualitative results from a user deployment show that a performative approach to modeling emotion is possible. We thus demonstrate the potential of performative theories to be generative of new computational and design practices that support hybrid human-machine enactments of emotion.},

Yet, as focus in HCI is expanding to investigate complex matters of human relationships with technology over time in the intimate and contested contexts of everyday life, the notion of a 'prototype' may not be fully sufficient to support these kinds of inquiries. We propose the research product as an extension and evolution of the research prototype to support generative inquiries in this emerging research area. We articulate four interrelated qualities of research products inquiry-driven, finish, fit, and independent and draw on these qualities to describe and analyze five different yet related design research cases we have collectively conducted over the past six years. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities for crafting research products and the implications they suggest for future design-oriented HCI research.},

abstract = {Using as data videotapes of archaeologists making maps, and lawyers animating events visible on the Rodney King videotape, this article investigates the discursive practices used by members of a profession to shape events in the phenomenal environment they focus their attention upon, the domain of their professional scrutiny, into the objects of knowledge that become the insignia of their profession: the theories, artifacts and bodies of expertise that are its special domain of competence and set it apart from other groups. Seeing is investigated as a socially situated, historically constituted body of practices through which the objects of knowledge which animate the discourse of a profession are constructed and shaped. Analysis focuses on three practices, coding schemes, highlighting, and the articulation of graphic representations, which are articulated in a work relevant way within sequences of human interaction. Through the structure of talk in interaction members of a profession hold accountable for, and contest, the proper constitution and perception of the objects that define their professional competence. Professional Vision This article investigates the discursive practices used by members of a profession to shape events in the domain of professional scrutiny they focus their attention upon. The shaping process creates the objects of knowledge that become the insignia of a profession's craft: the theories, artifacts and bodies of expertise that are its special and distinctive domain of competence. Analysis of the methods used by members of a community to build and contest the events that structure their lifeworld contributes to the development of a practice-based theory of knowledge and action. 1 Two contexts of professional activity are examined: archaeological field excavation and legal argumentation. In each of these contexts three practices are investigated: 1) coding schemes used to transform the materials being attended to in a specific setting into the objects of knowledge that animate the discourse of a profession; 2) highlighting, making specific phenomena in a complex perceptual field salient by marking them in some fashion; and 3) the production and articulation of material representations. By applying such practices to phenomena in the domain of scrutiny, participants build and contest professional vision, socially organized ways of seeing and understanding events that are answerable to the distinctive interests of a particular social group. In the 1992 trial of four white policemen charged with beating Mr. Rodney King, an African-American motorist who had been stopped for speeding, a videotape of the 1 See Bourdieu (1997), Chaiklin and Lave (1993), Hanks (1987) and Lave and Wenger (1991) for contemporary work on practice theory. Analysis of how cognition makes use phenomena distributed in everyday settings can be found inLave 1988; Rogoff 1990; Rogoff and Lave 1984; and Suchman 1987) Hutchins (1993) provides a very clear demonstration of how cognition is not located in the mind of a single individual, but instead embedded within distributed systems including socially differentiated actors, and external representations embodied in tools. Dougherty and Keller 1985) demonstrate how cognitive frameworks and material features of a setting mutually constitute each other. A collection of recent work by linguistic anthropologists on the discursive constitution of context can be found in Duranti and Goodwin 1992). Work on Activity Theory (Wertsch 1985; Engestr{\"{o}}m 1987) growing out of the pioneering work of Vygotsky (1978) has long stressed the mediated, historically shaped character of both cognition and social organization. Though focused on the organization of sequences of talk rather than tool-mediated cognition, the field of Conversation Analysis (Atkinson and Heritage 1984; Drew and Heritage 1992; Sacks 1992; Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson 1974) has developed the most powerful resources currently available for the analysis of the interactive organization of emerging action with actual settings (Goodwin 1990), including the way in which each next action relies upon prior action for its proper interpretation while simultaneously reshaping the context that will provide the ground for subsequent action.},

We illustrate this with examples from contemporary arts and design practice, and distinguish three broad classes of ambiguity according to where uncertainty is located in the interpretative relationship linking person and artefact. Ambiguity of information finds its source in the artefact itself, ambiguity of context in the sociocultural discourses that are used to interpret it, and ambiguity of relationship in the interpretative and evaluative stance of the individual. For each of these categories, we describe tactics for emphasising ambiguity that may help designers and other practitioners understand and craft its use.},

Existing technologies, however, cannot be used effectively in continuous, uninterrupted modes for more than a few days due to irritation and irreversible degradation in the electrical and mechanical properties of the skin interface. Here we introduce a soft, foldable collection of electrodes in open, fractal mesh geometries that can mount directly and chronically on the complex surface topology of the auricle and the mastoid, to provide high-fidelity and long-term capture of electroencephalograms in ways that avoid any significant thermal, electrical, or mechanical loading of the skin. Experimental and computational studies establish the fundamental aspects of the bending and stretching mechanics that enable this type of intimate integration on the highly irregular and textured surfaces of the auricle. Cell level tests and thermal imaging studies establish the biocompatibility and wearability of such systems, with examples of high-quality measurements over periods of 2 wk with devices that remain mounted throughout daily activities including vigorous exercise, swimming, sleeping, and bathing. Demonstrations include a text speller with a steady-state visually evoked potential-based brain–computer interface and elicitation of an event-related potential (P300 wave).},

abstract = {Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) has revolutionized computer vision through end-to-end learning, i.e. learning from the raw data. Now, there is increasing interest in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis. However, little is known about many important aspects of how to design and train ConvNets for end-to-end EEG decoding, and there is still a lack of techniques to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn. Here, we studied deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed movements from raw EEG. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching or surpassing that of the widely-used filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) decoding algorithm. While FBCSP is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta and high gamma frequencies. These methods also proved useful as a technique for spatially mapping the learned features, revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to decoding the movement classes. Our study thus shows how to design and train ConvNets to decode movement-related information from the raw EEG without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.},

It uses the One Laptop per Child project as a case study for exploring the features, benefits, and pitfalls of charisma. It then contextualizes OLPC's charismatic power in the historical arc of other charismatic technologies, highlighting the enduring nature of charisma and the common themes on which the charisma of a century of technological progress rests. In closing, it discusses how scholars and practitioners in human-computer interaction might use the concept of charismatic technology in their own work.},

In this paper, we describe a scalable end- to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quan- tile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compres- sion and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

abstract = {Distributed cognition is a framework for thinking about cognition which seeks to understand how the cognitive properties of aggregates emerge from the interactions of component parts. It can be applied to cognitive systems at many levels of complexity, from areas of an individual brain to communities of interacting persons. Distributed cognition is sometimes construed as a special kind of cognition that occurs when people are in interaction with one another or with material artifacts. This is only partly correct. Rather than being a kind of cognition, distributed cognition is a manner of thinking about cognition that permits one to examine the relationships between what is in the mind and the world the mind is in. When applied to groups of persons, distributed cognition provides a language for cognitive processes that are distributed across the members of a social group, between people and their material environments, and through time. It attempts to use an understanding of the social, cultural, and material context of cognitive practices to constrain models of cognitive processes within and among individual minds.},

abstract = {Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this "hierarchical prediction machine" approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.},

ERP signals are in most cases able to reliably reflect cognitive processes, and are widely used in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research. We present work in progress towards the application of these techniques to emerging consumer-grade BCI technology. Our approach has an impact on the reliability and usability of consumer Brain Computer Interfaces in commercial contexts, and is already being adopted by our industry partners in the games and entertainment sector. It could also significantly reduce the cost and complexity of certain types of large scale ERP research.

abstract = {How we design and evaluate for emotions depends crucially on what we take emotions to be. In affective computing, affect is often taken to be another kind of information-discrete units or states internal to an individual that can be transmitted in a loss-free manner from people to computational systems and back. While affective computing explicitly challenges the primacy of rationality in cognitivist accounts of human activity, at a deeper level it often relies on and reproduces the same information-processing model of cognition. Drawing on cultural, social, and interactional critiques of cognition which have arisen in human-computer interaction (HCI), as well as anthropological and historical accounts of emotion, we explore an alternative perspective on emotion as interaction: dynamic, culturally mediated, and socially constructed and experienced. We demonstrate how this model leads to new goals for affective systems-instead of sensing and transmitting emotion, systems should support human users in understanding, interpreting, and experiencing emotion in its full complexity and ambiguity. In developing from emotion as objective, externally measurable unit to emotion as experience, evaluation, too, alters focus from externally tracking the circulation of emotional information to co-interpreting emotions as they are made in interaction. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The human body was made legible long ago. But what of the human mind? Is it possible to ‘read' the mind, for one human being to know what another is thinking or feeling, their beliefs and intentions. And if I can read your mind, how about others – could our authorities, in the criminal justice system or the security ser- vices? Some developments in contemporary neuroscience suggest the answer to this question is ‘yes'. While philosophers continue to debate the mind-brain problem, a range of novel technologies of brain imaging have been used to argue that specific mental states, and even specific thoughts, can be identified by charac- teristic patterns of brain activation; this has led some to propose their use in practices ranging fromlie detection and security screening to the assessment of brain activity in persons in persistent vegetative states. This article reviews the history of these developments, sketches their scientific and technical bases, considers some of the epistemological and ontological mutations involved, explores the ecological niches where they have found a hospitable environment, and considers some implications of this materialization of the readable, knowable, transparent mind.},

We undertake an experimental study of the usability and performance of user authentication using consumer-grade EEG sensor technology. By choosing custom tasks and custom acceptance thresholds for each sub- ject, we can achieve 99{\%} authentication accuracy using single-channel EEG signals, which is on par with previous research employing multi- channel EEG signals using clinical-grade devices. In addition to the us- ability improvement o ered by the single-channel dry-contact EEG sen- sor, we also study the usability of di erent classes of mental tasks. We nd that subjects have little diculty recalling chosen $\backslash$pass-thoughts" (e.g., their previously selected song to sing in their mind). They also have di erent preferences for tasks based on the perceived diculty and enjoyability of the tasks. These results can inform the design of authen- tication systems that guide users in choosing tasks that are both usable and secure.},

However, such kind of technology presents some important drawbacks such as the price and the difficulty to prepare the system without an expert's support. This work intends to build a user-friendly, self-paced Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that allows using commercial EEG headsets in order to drive an electrical wheelchair with a motor imagery approach. Furthermore, the conceived system has been used for a first evaluation of a commercial, low-cost, EEG device compared with data coming from a professional device. The result shows that the low cost EEG device, at the actual state of the art, provide interesting results but can hardly be used for self-paced systems in error sensitive context.},

We introduced participants to a crudely-built mock brain scanner, explaining that the machine would measure neural activity, analyze the data, and then infer the content of complex thoughts. Using a classic magic trick, we crafted an illusion whereby the imaging technology seemed to decipher the internal thoughts of participants. We found that most students-even undergraduates with advanced standing in neuroscience and psychology, who have been taught the shortcomings of neuroimaging-deemed such unlikely technology highly plausible. Our findings highlight the influence neuro-hype wields over critical thinking.},
